<h1 align="center"><strong>RRE3D</strong></h1>
Rapid Raster Engine (RRE) is a lightweight Object-Oriented 3D rendering project for fast software development and multiple graphics backends.
It may also be considered a wrapper for GLFW.

<h2 align="center"><strong>Downloading & Implementing</strong></h2>
It is recommended that you get the latest download from <a href="https://github.com/vortexdevsoftware/RRE3D/releases">Releases</a>, you may also compile it yourself
using the already provided <a href="BUILD.md">build commands</a>.

<h2 align="center"><strong>Overview</strong></h2>
RRE3D Entities are loosely modelled as C++ classes that provide their own graphics routines and 3D game logic. This makes it a simple and easy-to-use interface designed to minimize the effort required to render 3D scenes, therefore allowing developers to focus on viewable content rather than the mechanics of 3D graphics and rendering of 3D objects.

<h3 align="center"><strong>Platform & 3D API support</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>OpenGL & Vulkan API support</li>
  <li>Windows 10 and 11</li>
  <li>Compilable with MSVC and MinGW g++</li>
</ul>
Due to driver support discrepancies between hardware manufacturers, Windows 7, 8 and 8.1 may experience issues depending on the brand of video adapter.

<h2 align="center"><strong>Objective</strong></h2>
The aim of the RRE3D graphics engine is to bring unification and simplicity to 3D C++ application development, minimizing the amount of steps and time used into the creation of 3D environments. Produce phenomenal yet stunning results that are on par with the competition. <br>

<h3 align="center">Learning Resources</h3>
The RRE3D repository provides several free open source examples, scenarios and important tutorials that can be easily applied into any game, see them <a href="https://github.com/vortexdevsoftware/RRE3D/tree/main/examples">here</a>.<br>

<h2 align="center"><strong>Open Source Technologies Used</strong></h2>
RRE3D was made possible with the following open source technologies:<br><br>
<a href="https://www.glfw.org/">GLFW</a> - Window<br>
<a href="https://github.com/nothings/stb">stb_image.h</a> - Texture Loading<br>
<a href="http://assimp.org/">Assimp</a> - Model Loading<br>
