<h1 align="center"><strong>RRE3D</strong></h1>
Rapid Raster Engine (RRE) is a lightweight Object-Oriented 3D rendering project for rapid software development and multiple graphics backends.

<h2 align="center"><strong>Downloading & Implementing</strong></h2>
It is recommended that you get the latest download from <a href="https://github.com/vortexdevsoftware/RRE3D/releases">Releases</a>, you can also compile it yourself
using the already provided build commands.

<h2 align="center"><strong>Overview</strong></h2>
RRE3D Entities are loosely modeled as C++ classes that provide their own graphics routines and 3D game logic, this makes it a simple and easy-to-use interface designed to minimize the effort required to render 3D scenes, allowing developers to focus on content rather than 3D graphics and rendering of 3D objects.

<h3 align="center"><strong>Platform & 3D API support</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>OpenGL & Vulkan Support</li>
  <li>Windows (all major versions)</li>
  <li>Compilable with MSVC or MinGW G++</li>
</ul>

<h2 align="center"><strong>Objective</strong></h2>
The aim of the RRE3D graphics engine is to bring plain simplicity to 3D C++ application development and produce results quickly.<br>

<h3 align="center">Learning Resources</h3>
The RRE3D repository provides several free examples, scenarios and important tutorials that can be easily extended into a game, see them <a href="https://github.com/vortexdevsoftware/RRE3D/tree/main/examples">here</a>.<br>

<h2 align="center"><strong>Open Source Technologies Used</strong></h2>
RRE3D was made possible with the following open source technologies:<br><br>
<a href="https://www.glfw.org/">GLFW</a><br>
<a href="https://github.com/nothings/stb">stb_image.h</a><br>
